  An internal resolved representation of a <a href='Binding-class.html'><code>Binding</code></a> used by the <a href='Injector-class.html'><code>Injector</code></a>.
  
  A <a href='Binding-class.html'><code>Binding</code></a> is resolved when it has a factory function. Binding to a class, alias, or
  value, are just convenience methods, as <a href='Injector-class.html'><code>Injector</code></a> only operates on calling factory
  functions.
