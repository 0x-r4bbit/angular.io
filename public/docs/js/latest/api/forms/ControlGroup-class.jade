  Defines a part of a form, of fixed length, that can contain other controls.
  
  A ControlGroup aggregates the values and errors of each [Control] in the group. Thus, if one of the controls in a
  group is invalid, the entire group is invalid. Similarly, if a control changes its value, the entire group changes
  as well.
  
  `ControlGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular, along with [Control]
  and [ControlArray]. [ControlArray] can also contain other controls, but is of variable length.
