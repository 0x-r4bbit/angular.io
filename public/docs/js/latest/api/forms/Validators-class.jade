  This module is used for handling user input, by defining and building a <a href='ControlGroup-class.html'><code>ControlGroup</code></a> that
  consists of
  <a href='Control-class.html'><code>Control</code></a> objects, and mapping them onto the DOM. <a href='Control-class.html'><code>Control</code></a> objects can then be used
  to read information
  from the form DOM elements.
  
  This module is not included in the `angular2` module; you must import the forms module
  explicitly.
